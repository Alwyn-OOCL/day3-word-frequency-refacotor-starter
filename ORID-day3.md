Rewarding
- After Learning & Praticing Refactoring, recfatocing my code like `MarsRover` becomes more convenient. *Quick and positive feedback* makes me feel rewarding.

# I
- As the saying goes —— Teaching others teaches yourself. I shared my MarsRover code in class this morning and showed my *Strategy Pattern* & thought-out *direction design* and then I received differrnt kinds of feedback which makes me try to refactor my code and think more. This really makes me feel rewarding.
- Using concept map helps me and my teammate to *review and summary* knowledge we learned last 3 days. Brainstorming help us find some other idea I overlooked.

# D
- Review & summary more in next days.
- Try to refactor my code with refactoring methods mentioned today.
- Replace all for loop with stream
- Increase communication frequency and think about others' ideas.
